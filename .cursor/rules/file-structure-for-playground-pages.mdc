description: When generating pages (demos) in playground
alwaysApply: false

All pages within the playground follow this structure:

```
PageName/
  ├── index.tsx #note: not `ts`
  ├── data/ #when necessary
  └── components/
```

Here, `index.tsx` serves not only as the public exports but also contains the basic page structure (refer to PageProps). When no suitable components are available in `src/components/`, all temporary components should be placed in `PageName/components/`, following the specifications outlined in [component-structure.mdc](./component-structure.mdc).
