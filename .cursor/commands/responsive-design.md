# Responsive Design

Implement container-based responsive design for the specified component or page element according to the guidelines in @responsive-design.mdc. 

The target component/element will be specified by the user. Apply the ResizeObserver pattern to ensure the component adapts to its container size rather than viewport size. Implement appropriate breakpoints, update styles dynamically based on container width, and ensure proper cleanup of observers.
